# Semantic HTML Homework

For this assigment, I modified the html code of an existing website. The goal of the modification was to make sure the website visually looked unchanged to the user, but to improve the sites accessibility and improve it's SEO. I was able to successfully change much of the code to semantic HTML, as well as cleaning it up for easier reading for future developers to work on. There were some navigation links that weren't working properly and images without a helpful <alt> descriptions.
